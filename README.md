Which version should I download?
================================

Linux users:-

If you already have JAVA 8 (or greater) runtime, then select either:-
 > searchmonkey-3.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar (to get everything)
 > searchmonkey-3.0.0.jar (to get the bare minimum install)
 
Windows users:-

If you already have JAVA 8 runtime installed on your computer, then select:-
 > searchmonkey_lite_v3.0.0.exe

To get the full installation pack which includes a full copy of the 64-bit and 32-bit JAVA runtimes:- 
 > searchmonkey_full_v3.0.0.exe
 
 
Enjoy!
